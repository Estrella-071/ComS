# Preface

Computers play a large part in our everyday lives and will continue to do so in the future. Computer science is a young discipline that is evolving and progressing. Computer networks have connected people from far-flung points of the globe. Virtual reality is creating three-dimensional images that amaze the eyes. Space exploration owes part of its success to computers. Computer-generated special effects have changed the movie industry. Computers have played important roles in genetics.

## Audience
This book is written for both academic and professional audience. The book can be used as a self-study guide for interested professionals. As a textbook, it can be used for a one-semester or one-quarter course. It is designed as the first course in computer science. This book is designed for a CS0 course based on the recommendations of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). It covers all areas of computer science in breadth. The book, totally or partially, can also be used in other disciplines where the students need to have a bird’s-eye view approach to the computer science.

## Changes in the fourth edition
I have made several categories of changes in this edition.

### Revised chapters and appendices
Minor changes have been made to almost all the chapters. Two new chapters have been added (Chapters 19 and 20). Some materials have been removed from Chapter 4, expanded and inserted as two new appendices (Appendices I and J).

### Organization
The book is made of 20 chapters and 10 appendices.

## Chapters
Chapters are intended to provide the basic materials. However, not all chapters are needed for every audience. The professor who teaches the course can decide which chapters to use. We give guidance below.

## Appendices
The appendices are intended to provide a quick reference or review of materials needed to understand the concepts discussed in the book. There are ten appendices that can be used by the students for reference and study.

## Acronyms
The book contains a list of acronyms for finding the corresponding terms quickly.

## Glossary
The book contains an extensive glossary giving full explanations of the terms used in the book.

## Pedagogy
Several pedagogical features of this text are designed to make it particularly easy for students to understand the materials.

### Visual approach
The book presents highly technical subject matter without complex formulas by using a balance of text and figures. More than 400 figures accompanying the text provide a visual and intuitive opportunity for understanding the material. Figures are particularly important in explaining the relationship between components of a whole. For many students, these concepts are more easily grasped visually than verbally.

### Highlighted points
I have repeated important concepts in boxes for quick reference and immediate attention.

### Examples and applications
Whenever appropriate, I have included examples that illustrate the concepts introduced in the text.

### Algorithms
The inclusion of algorithms in the text helps students with problem solving and programming.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
Throughout the book I have used UML diagrams to make students familiar with this tool, which is becoming the de facto standard in the industry.

## End-of-chapter materials
Each chapter ends with a set of materials that includes the following:

### Recommended reading
This section gives a brief list of references relative to the chapter. The references can be used to quickly find the corresponding literature.

### Key terms
The new terms used in each chapter are listed at the end of the chapter and their definitions are included in the glossary.

### Summary
Each chapter ends with a summary of the material covered by that chapter. The summary consolidates the important learning points in one place for ease of access by students.

### Practice set
Each chapter includes a practice set designed to reinforce salient concepts and encourage students to apply them. It consists of three parts: quizzes, questions, and problems.

*   **Quizzes**: Quizzes, which are posted on the book website, provide quick concept checking. Students can take these quizzes to check their understanding of the materials. The feedback to the students’ responses is given immediately.
*   **Questions**: This section contains simple questions about the concepts discussed in the book. Answers to the odd-numbered questions are posted on the book website to be checked by the student.
*   **Problems**: This section contains more difficult problems that need a deeper understanding of the materials discussed in the chapter. I strongly recommend that the student trys to solve all of these problems. Answers to the odd-numbered problems are also posted on the book website to be checked by the student.

## How to use the book
The chapters in the book are organized to provide a great deal of flexibility. I suggest the following:
*   Materials provided in Chapters 1 to 8 are essential to understand the rest of the book.
*   Materials provided in Chapters 9 to 14 can be taught if the time allows. They can be skipped in a quarter system.
*   Chapters 15 to 20 can be taught at the discretion of the professor and the majors of students.

## Acknowledgments
It is obvious that the development of a book of this scope needs the support of many people.

# 前言

電腦在我們的日常生活中扮演著重要的角色，並且在未來將繼續如此。電腦科學是一門年輕且不斷發展進步的學科。電腦網路連接了全球各地的人們。虛擬實境創造出令人驚嘆的三維影像。太空探索的成功部分歸功於電腦。電腦生成的特效改變了電影工業。電腦在遺傳學中也扮演了重要的角色。

## 目標讀者
本書專為學術及專業讀者撰寫。有興趣的專業人士可將本書作為自學指南。作為教科書，它可用於一學期或一季的課程，設計為電腦科學的第一門課。本書根據計算機協會（ACM）的建議設計為 CS0 課程，廣泛涵蓋電腦科學的所有領域。本書的全部或部分內容也可用於其他學科，讓學生對電腦科學有一個鳥瞰式的了解。

## 第四版的變更
我在這個版本中做了幾類變更。

### 修訂的章節與附錄
幾乎所有章節都做了微幅修改。新增了兩個新章節（第 19 章和第 20 章）。第 4 章的部分內容被移除、擴充並作為兩個新附錄（附錄 I 和 J）插入。

### 組織架構
本書由 20 個章節和 10 個附錄組成。

## 章節
章節旨在提供基礎材料。然而，並非所有章節都適用於每位讀者。授課教授可以決定使用哪些章節。我們在下方提供指引。

## 附錄
附錄旨在提供快速參考或複習理解書中概念所需的材料。書中有十個附錄可供學生參考和學習。

## 縮寫詞
本書包含一個縮寫詞列表，以便快速查找對應的術語。

## 詞彙表
本書包含一個詳盡的詞彙表，對書中使用的術語提供完整解釋。

## 教學法
本書的幾個教學特色旨在讓學生特別容易理解材料。

### 視覺化方法
本書透過平衡的文字和圖表來呈現高度技術性的主題，而無需複雜的公式。超過 400 幅圖伴隨文本，為理解材料提供了視覺化和直觀的機會。圖表在解釋整體各組成部分之間的關係時尤其重要。對許多學生來說，這些概念透過視覺比透過文字更容易掌握。

### 重點提示
我將重要的概念重複放在方框中，以便快速參考和立即注意。

### 範例與應用
在適當的時候，我加入了範例來說明文本中介紹的概念。

### 演算法
在文本中包含演算法有助於學生解決問題和編程。

## 統一塑模語言 (UML)
在整本書中，我使用 UML 圖表讓學生熟悉這個工具，它正成為業界的實質標準。

## 章末材料
每章結尾都有一套材料，包括以下內容：

### 推薦閱讀
本節提供與該章相關的簡短參考資料列表。這些參考資料可用於快速查找相關文獻。

### 關鍵詞
每章使用的新術語列於章末，其定義包含在詞彙表中。

### 摘要
每章結尾都有該章內容的摘要。摘要將重要的學習點彙整在一處，方便學生查閱。

### 練習題
每章都包含一組練習題，旨在鞏固重要概念並鼓勵學生應用。它由三部分組成：測驗、問題和習題。

*   **測驗**：發佈在書籍網站上的測驗，提供快速的概念檢查。學生可以參加這些測驗來檢查他們對材料的理解。學生的回答會立即得到反饋。
*   **問題**：本節包含關於書中討論概念的簡單問題。奇數題的答案發佈在書籍網站上，供學生核對。
*   **習題**：本節包含較難的問題，需要對章節中討論的材料有更深入的理解。我強烈建議學生嘗試解決所有這些問題。奇數題的答案也發佈在書籍網站上，供學生核對。

## 如何使用本書
本書的章節組織提供了很大的靈活性。我建議如下：
*   第 1 至 8 章提供的材料是理解本書其餘部分的基礎。
*   如果時間允許，可以教授第 9 至 14 章的材料。在季制（quarter system）中可以跳過。
*   第 15 至 20 章可由教授根據學生主修酌情教授。

## 致謝
顯然，開發一本如此規模的書需要許多人的支持。
