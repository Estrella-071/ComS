# Preface

Welcome to the C programming language and to C How to Program, Eighth Edition! This book presents leading-edge computing technologies for college students, instructors and software-development professionals.

At the heart of the book is the Deitel signature “live-code approach”—we present concepts in the context of complete working programs, rather than in code snippets. Each code example is followed by one or more sample executions. Read the online Before You Begin section at http://www.deitel.com/books/chtp8/chtp8_BYB.pdf to learn how to set up your computer to run the hundreds of code examples. All the source code is available at www.pearsonglobaleditions.com/deitel

Use the source code we provide to run every program as you study it.

We believe that this book and its support materials will give you an informative, challenging and entertaining introduction to C. As you read the book, if you have questions, send an e-mail to deitel@deitel.com—we'll respond promptly. For book updates, visit www.deitel.com/books/chtp8/, join our social media communities:

## New and Updated Features

Here are some key features of C How to Program, 8/e:

*   **Integrated More Capabilities of the C11 and C99 standards.** Support for the C11 and C99 standards varies by compiler. Microsoft Visual C++ supports a subset of the features that were added to C in C99 and C11—primarily the features that are also required by the C++ standard. We incorporated several widely supported C11 and C99 features into the book's early chapters, as appropriate for introductory courses and for the compilers we used in this book. Appendix E, Multithreading and Other C11 and C99 Topics, presents more advanced features (such as multithreading for today's increasingly popular multi-core architectures) and various other features that are not widely supported by today's C compilers.
*   **All Code Tested on Linux, Windows and OS X.** We retested all the example and exercise code using GNU gcc on Linux, Visual C++ on Windows (in Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition) and LLVM in Xcode on OS X.
*   **Updated Chapter 1.** The new Chapter 1 engages students with updated intriguing facts and figures to get them excited about studying computers and computer programming. The chapter includes current technology trends and hardware discussions, the data hierarchy, social networking and a table of business and technology publications and websites that will help you stay up to date with the latest technology news and trends. We've included updated test-drives that show how to run a command-line C program on Linux, Microsoft Windows and OS X. We also updated the discussions of the Internet and web, and the introduction to object technology.
*   **Updated Coverage of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming.** We updated Chapters 15–23 on object-oriented programming in C++ with material from our textbook C++ How to Program, 9/e, which is up-to-date with the C++11 standard.
*   **Updated Code Style.** We removed the spacing inside parentheses and square brackets, and toned down our use of comments a bit. We also added parentheses to certain compound conditions for clarity.
*   **Variable Declarations.** Because of improved compiler support, we were able to move variable declarations closer to where they're first used and define for-loop counter-control variables in each for's initialization section.
*   **Summary Bullets.** We removed the end-of-chapter terminology lists and updated the detailed section-by-section, bullet-list summaries with bolded key terms and, for most, page references to their defining occurrences.
*   **Use of Standard Terminology.** To help students prepare to work in industry worldwide, we audited the book against the C standard and upgraded our terminology to use C standard terms in preference to general programming terms.
*   **Online Debugger Appendices.** We've updated the online GNU gdb and Visual C++® debugging appendices, and added an Xcode® debugging appendix.
*   **Additional Exercises.** We updated various exercises and added some new ones, including one for the Fisher-Yates unbiased shuffling algorithm in Chapter 10.

## Other Features

Other features of C How to Program, 8/e include:

*   **Secure C Programming Sections.** Many of the C chapters end with a Secure C Programming Section. We've also posted a Secure C Programming Resource Center at www.deitel.com/SecureC/. For more details, see the section “A Note About Secure C Programming” on the next page.
*   **Focus on Performance Issues.** C (and C++) are favored by designers of performance-intensive systems such as operating systems, real-time systems, embedded systems and communications systems, so we focus intensively on performance issues.
*   **"Making a Difference" Contemporary Exercises.** We encourage you to use computers and the Internet to research and solve significant problems. These exercises are meant to increase awareness of important issues the world is facing. We hope you'll approach them with your own values, politics and beliefs.
*   **Sorting: A Deeper Look.** Sorting places data in order, based on one or more sort keys. We begin our sorting presentation in Chapter 6 with a simple algorithm— in Appendix D, we present a deeper look. We consider several algorithms and compare them with regard to their memory consumption and processor demands. For this purpose, we present a friendly introduction to Big O notation, which indicates how hard an algorithm may have to work to solve a problem. Through examples and exercises, Appendix D discusses the selection sort, insertion sort, recursive merge sort, recursive selection sort, bucket sort and recursive Quicksort. Sorting is an intriguing problem because different sorting techniques achieve the same final result but they can vary hugely in their consumption of memory, CPU time and other system resources.
*   **Titled Programming Exercises.** Most of the programming exercises are titled to help instructors conveniently choose assignments appropriate for their students.
*   **Order of Evaluation.** We caution the reader about subtle order of evaluation issues.
*   **C++-Style // Comments.** We use the newer, more concise C++-style // comments in preference to C's older style /*...*/ comments.
